#### Regarding this project
It contains 2 models that learn to predict XOR logic gates:

1. A 2-layer NN using sigmoid function
2. A l-layer NN using "relu" for the first l-1 layers and "sigmoid" for the last layer

#### Hyper-parameters needs to be set before running the model:
col_num = columne num (e.g., 10)
layer_dims = layer dimensions (e.g., 2, 5, 1)(no bracket needed around the serie of numbers
learning_rate = learning rate for updateing the parameters W & b (e.g., 0.1)
iteration = number of times used to train the model (e.g., 50000)
